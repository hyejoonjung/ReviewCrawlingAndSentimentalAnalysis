Don't like the shape, size or the smell or the way it lathers or lack of lathering plus I notice it sort of disappears really quick.  The old bar used to last me a couple of months in the shower, now the new one is basically gone in about 3 weeks.  Hope I can find a similar soap to replace my old favorite.""]"

5,B005HO0A1S,1.0,"['December 10, 2018']",['Zee NYC'],"['They changed their formula, packaging, and manufacturing again....']",['3.0 out of 5 stars'],"[""I've been using Lever2000 for quite a long time. One of the main reasons I began using it was because it was anti-bacterial. Unfortunately a few years ago they had to change their formula due to the FDA restricting the use of anti-bacterial chemicals in common household soaps. Whether or not the ingredient was actually effective or not is pretty controversial however I still liked their old formula better. I still use the soap from time to time when my favorite soap is not on sale simply because I've grown accustomed to it over the years. It's not as moisturizing as my usual soap but it does cleanse well. I like both the original and the cucumber scents. In recent months they've cut back on packaging and the product is no longer boxed and they've changed the formula yet again. They are using some type of wrap which is not as biodegradable as paper. The shape of the soap has also changed to accommodate the new packaging. They also seem to have changed where the soap is being manufactured and due to that it appears to be milled differently. It is no longer made in the USA. As a result of all the new changes it's no longer one of my top choices when shopping for soap. It's still a good value for the price but if you know the old formula it's a bit tougher to find the current one acceptable. Especially when there are many better options out there.""]"

We loved the previous formulation, and were so disappointed to find that the new version is garbage. No bubbles, feels dry, grainy, and uncomfortable...this is supposed to be soap, not a cheap wool sweater that's been dragged across the beach."", ""We're debating on whether to toss the remaining bars in the bin because donating them seems cruel."", ""We'll buy again if you change back to the previous formulation.""]"
